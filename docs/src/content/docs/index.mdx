Lightweight SQLite WAL sync to S3 in Rust.

## Why Walsync?

Walsync is built for **control**, **efficiency**, and **Rust-native integration**.

### Control

You own the code. No black box, no surprises. If you need a custom feature or fix, you can implement it. Walsync is designed to be hackable and transparent.

### Memory Efficiency

Walsync's Rust implementation has a smaller memory footprint:

**Measured overhead:**
- **walsync:** ~12 MB baseline
- **Litestream:** ~33 MB baseline

For resource-constrained environments (small VMs, containers, edge deployments), this difference matters.

### Rust-Native

Walsync integrates naturally into Rust projects:
- Native async/await with tokio
- No CGO dependencies
- Smaller binary size (~8 MB)
- LTX format compatible with Litestream

## Installation

### CLI (Rust)

```bash
cargo install walsync
```

### Python

```bash
pip install walsync
```

### Verify

```bash
walsync --version
```

## Set Up Credentials

Configure your S3 credentials. Example for [Tigris](https://tigris.dev) (Fly.io):

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=tid_xxxxx
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=tsec_xxxxx
export AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3=https://fly.storage.tigris.dev
```

See [S3 Providers](/config/s3-providers/) for AWS, R2, MinIO, and other providers.

## Take a Snapshot

Back up your database to S3:

```bash
walsync snapshot myapp.db --bucket my-backups
```

Output:
```
Snapshotting myapp.db to s3://my-backups/myapp.db/...
✓ Snapshot complete (1.2 MB, 445ms)
  Checksum: a3f2b9c8d4e5f6a7...
```

## Watch for Changes

Continuously sync WAL changes:

```bash
walsync watch myapp.db --bucket my-backups
```

This watches for database changes and syncs them to S3. Run this as a background service in production.

## Restore

Restore a database from backup:

```bash
walsync restore myapp.db --bucket my-backups -o restored.db
```

Output:
```
Restoring myapp.db from s3://my-backups/...
  Downloading snapshot... done (1.2 MB)
  Verifying checksum... ✓
✓ Restored to restored.db
```

## Watch Multiple Databases

Sync multiple databases with a single process:

```bash
walsync watch app.db users.db analytics.db --bucket my-backups
```

## Create a Read Replica

Run a local read replica that polls S3 for changes:

```bash
walsync replicate s3://my-backups/myapp.db --local replica.db --interval 5s
```

Output:
```
Replicating s3://my-backups/myapp.db -> replica.db
Poll interval: 5s
Press Ctrl+C to stop

Bootstrapped from snapshot: 1024 pages, TXID 100
[10:30:05] Applied 1 LTX file(s), now at TXID 101
```

The replica auto-bootstraps from the latest snapshot if it doesn't exist, then applies incremental updates.
