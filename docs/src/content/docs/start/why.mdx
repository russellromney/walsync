title: Why Walsync?
description: What makes Walsync different from Litestream
---

## Production-Grade SQLite Backups

Walsync is a lightweight alternative to Litestream that combines the best of both worlds:
- **Explicit data integrity** via SHA256 checksums
- **Multi-database efficiency** with a single process
- **Minimal overhead** (~7MB binary, ~10MB RSS)

## Key Advantages

### 1. Explicit Data Integrity

Every snapshot includes a cryptographic SHA256 checksum stored in S3 metadata. During restore, checksums are automatically verified:

```
✓ Checksum stored during snapshot
✓ Verified automatically on restore
✓ Fail-fast on corruption detection
✓ Backward compatible (optional)
```

Unlike implicit S3 ETags, you get explicit proof that your database matches bit-for-bit.

### 2. Single Process for Many Databases

**Litestream Model:**
```
Database 1 → Litestream Process 1
Database 2 → Litestream Process 2
Database 3 → Litestream Process 3
              ...
```

Each database needs its own process. With 10 databases, that's 10 processes × 50MB = 500MB overhead.

**Walsync Model:**
```
Database 1 ──┐
Database 2 ──┼→ Walsync Process → S3
Database 3 ──┘
```

All databases share one process with shared S3 connection pooling. 10 databases = ~10MB total overhead.

| Scenario | Litestream | Walsync | Saved |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| 5 DB | 5 × 50MB | 1 × 10MB | **200 MB** |
| 10 DB | 10 × 50MB | 1 × 10MB | **450 MB** |
| 100 DB | 100 × 50MB | 1 × 10MB | **4950 MB** |

### 3. Lightweight Stack

Built in Rust instead of Go:
- **7MB binary** vs Litestream's ~50MB
- **No runtime bloat** - single executable
- **Minimal memory** - ~5-10MB RSS for multiple databases
- **Instant startup** - ~10ms vs Litestream's per-process overhead

### 4. Multiple Installation Options

- **CLI**: `cargo install walsync`
- **Python**: `pip install walsync`
- **Docker**: Coming soon

Use as a daemon, import as a library, or integrate into Python apps.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Walsync | Litestream |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Checksums** | ✅ Explicit SHA256 | ⚠️ Implicit E-Tag |
| **Process Model** | 1 for N databases | 1 per database |
| **Memory (5 DB)** | ~10MB | ~250MB |
| **Binary Size** | 7MB | 50MB |
| **Written in** | Rust | Go |
| **Python Bindings** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Data Integrity** | ✅ Tested & verified | ✅ Proven |

## When to Use Walsync

- ✅ **Multi-tenant apps** (Tenement, Slum) - Huge memory savings
- ✅ **Resource-constrained environments** - Edge, serverless, VPS
- ✅ **Python integration** - Use as a library in your app
- ✅ **Explicit verification** - Need guaranteed data integrity
- ✅ **Multiple databases** - One process scales to 100+ databases

## When to Use Litestream

- ✅ **Single database** - Litestream works fine for one database
- ✅ **Go familiarity** - If you prefer Go over Rust
- ✅ **Established production use** - Litestream has been battle-tested longer
